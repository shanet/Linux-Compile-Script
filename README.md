## Usage
This is a quick and dirty Bash script to automate Linux (kernel) compilies for Ubuntu systems. It is based off the instructions found at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/KernelTeam/GitKernelBuild

Simply download the kernel source, and give the path to the unpacked source to the script as a command line argument. It will walk you through the rest.
